### BalancePlot

This function shows the balance between the treatment and control groups by plotting the distrubtion of p-values for all of the covariates. By presenting the data in this way, it is easier to assess whether the p-values appear to be distrubed uniformly between 0 and 1, as would be expected in an experiment.

##### Usage

BalancePlot=function(Data, Treat, Covariates, Names.To.Print, Shade.Color = "blanchedalmond",
Title = "Balance Plot", Title.Size = 1.2, na.rm = FALSE,
Built.In.Tests = c("T.Test"), Point.Color = "red", Other.Tests = NULL,
pch = NULL, Year.Covariates = NULL, Observational.Data = NULL,
Observational.Treat = NULL, Observational.Point.Color = "blue",
Sample.Name = "Sub-Sample", O.Name = "All Units", Legend = FALSE,
Paired = FALSE, Observational.Paired = FALSE)

##### Arguments

Data:	A dataframe where the units are represented by rows and the covariates are included in the columns.

Treat:	Either the name of the (0,1) treatment variable in the dataframe or a vector of 0's and 1's indicating the treatment assignments for the units.

Covariates:	A vector listing the covariates, as they are named in the dataframe.

Names.To.Print:	A vector listing the names to be printed for the covariates.

Shade.Color	
The color of the alternating background bars.

Title:	The title of the balance plot.

Title.Size:	The size of the title.

na.rm:	Logical argument indicating whether NAs in the covariates should be ignored. Best practice is usually to impute and match on missingness.

Built.In.Tests:	Can be set at T.Test and/or KS.Test, or neither.

Point.Color:	The color of the points that will be plotted.

Other.Tests:	A vector with the names of other tests to be included, such as Permutation.Test. The functions for these tests must be loaded into R's gloval enviorment. The functions should take a treatment and control group as the first two arguments and return a p-value.

pch:	A vector specifying the style of the points for the additional tests.

Year.Covariates:	The names of any covariates that are years. These covariates will be printed in a different format.

Observational.Data:	A separate dataframe for the non-experimental data.

Observational.Treat:	Either the name of the (0,1) treatment variable in Observational.Data or a vector of 0's and 1's indicating the treatment assignments for the observational units.

Observational.Point.Color:	The color of the points that will be plotted for the observational data.

Legend:	Logical indicating whether to include a legend.

Sample.Name:	If specified, the name of the sample data to be printed in the legend.

O.Name:	If specified, the name of the observational data to be printed in the legend.

Paired:	If TRUE, then the t-tests and KS-tests will be paired.

Observational.Paired:	If TRUE, then the t-tests and KS-tests will be paired for the observational data.
